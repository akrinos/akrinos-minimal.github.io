      <description>I had a fantastic time teaching for Rainstorm last weekend! This was the first ever Rainstorm, an offshoot of the typical program put on by MIT&amp;rsquo;s Educational Studies Program (ESP). Along with their partner organization, Cloud Learning U/Learning Unlimited, they put together a virtual event this year to replace Spark!, which was set for March and, unfortunately, cancelled due to COVID-19.
I had about an hour to chat with high school students about Emiliania huxleyi and their viruses, one of my favorite topics!</description>
