      <description>Being a penpal for the Letters to a Pre-Scientist (LPS) program was one of the most valuable experiences I had during my first year in graduate school. I was inspired to participate in the program by my previous mentor at Virginia Tech. Paired with a sixth grader with some interest in ocean science, it was a joy to share in her curiosity and ambition. Though only in sixth grade, my pre-scientist penpal already has a plan in mind for her future.</description>

      <description>I had a fantastic time teaching for Rainstorm last weekend! This was the first ever Rainstorm, an offshoot of the typical program put on by MIT&amp;rsquo;s Educational Studies Program (ESP). Along with their partner organization, Cloud Learning U/Learning Unlimited, they put together a virtual event this year to replace Spark!, which was set for March and, unfortunately, cancelled due to COVID-19.
I had about an hour to chat with high school students about Emiliania huxleyi and their viruses, one of my favorite topics!</description>

      <description>This week, I&amp;rsquo;m finishing up my first experience with a couple of Software Carpentry courses. This set of courses - one on Python and one on R - was organized for the Summer Student Fellows and incoming Joint Program students at WHOI.
  The clever Software Carpentry logo.
  This time around, I was a helper, but the experience was eye-opening and rewarding. In particular, I had the chance to teach one of the episodes myself during the Python course.</description>
