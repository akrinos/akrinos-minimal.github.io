      <description>Being a penpal for the Letters to a Pre-Scientist (LPS) program was one of the most valuable experiences I had during my first year in graduate school. I was inspired to participate in the program by my previous mentor at Virginia Tech. Paired with a sixth grader with some interest in ocean science, it was a joy to share in her curiosity and ambition. Though only in sixth grade, my pre-scientist penpal already has a plan in mind for her future.</description>

      <description>I had a fantastic time teaching for Rainstorm last weekend! This was the first ever Rainstorm, an offshoot of the typical program put on by MIT&amp;rsquo;s Educational Studies Program (ESP). Along with their partner organization, Cloud Learning U/Learning Unlimited, they put together a virtual event this year to replace Spark!, which was set for March and, unfortunately, cancelled due to COVID-19.
I had about an hour to chat with high school students about Emiliania huxleyi and their viruses, one of my favorite topics!</description>

      <description>I am a biological oceanographer and microbial ecologist in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, where I study coccolithophores using bioinformatics and modeling.
I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2019, where I studied Computer Science, Biological Sciences, and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics. I have had a long-standing interest in mathematics and operational thinking on one hand, and biology, marine science, and naturalism of the other, and I have been so pleasantly surprised to find a natural combination of the two in my work.</description>
